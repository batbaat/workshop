## Notes

So we can think of the economy and society as being composed of a rich set of
interactions between a very large number of adaptive agents, all of which are co‐
evolving.  These are the classic circumstances which create what physicists and
biologists call Complex Adaptive Systems.

### Question: What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?
A complex adaptive system is a system where looking at the individual parts of the system do not give a perfect understanding to the system as a whole. Barder uses instances in nature and weather as examples of complex adaptive systems, stating that although you cannot tell whether or not it will rain in London on a particular day, you can estimate the weather in July as whole. Some features of these systems that Barder mentions are that they are difficult to predict individually, however they can be predicted as a whole. These systems also tend to become more complex as they grow, with their growth not leading to any equilibrium. 

### Question: Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010. Why? What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate economic models?
Barder compared the growth of South Korea and Ghana to introduce the question of why nations grow. He notes how both countries had similar economies before 1960, but South Korea’s economy grew rapidly after the 1970’s. Barder uses the comparison between these two countries to show that early economic models are incomplete in assessing why certain countries develop. This ties into him using Amartya Sen’s definition of development, as he is showing that using averages is not a precise way of measuring development, similar to Sen.
