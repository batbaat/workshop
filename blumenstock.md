# Response to Blumenstock - Don't forget about humans in data for development

### What are some of the promises and pitfalls associated with data science?

The promises that Blumenstock mention in this article are that data collected through various means, such as Facebook and international call usage, can be interpreted and used to create conclusions because of how much of a digital signature each user leaves behind. It can also be used to help larger groups of people as a whole, and aid with such tasks as humanitarian aid. 

The downsides mentioned in this article are a lack of validity, as data that proves helpful in one country may not be useful in another, along with people realizing that they are being monitored, which incentivizes them to “game” the system and act in ways to benefit them, which exposes the fact of the lack of regulation. Overall, the downsides of humble data are split between the data itself and through the uncertainty and selfishness of people, such as greed and profit.

Blumenstock mentions in this article that the best ways to refining the algorithms are to build off of and compliment older sources of data, not simply replace them. He also mentions customizing algorithms to each specific region, as methods that may work in first world countries may replicate the same accuracy as poorer countries. 

I believe that to help ameliorate the problems discussed by our classmates, customization and collaboration between government and private groups are necessary to move forward. Doing these will help to aid in each specific case that is being worked on, as stated before algorithms that are helpful in certain countries may not be helpful in others, so gathering data on different items in different countries tailored to their needs/availability will give results to the intent that they may have. Giving the responsibility of innovation to a shared collaboration for public and private groups will allow the good intented government groups monitor the private companies, allowing for both results and good intentions to come together. 

### What is big data?

Big data is a mass amount of information that is collected, whether to gather info. about people or to compare groups to others. 



### What is machine learning?

Machine learning is the use of artificial intelligence that uses and learns from inputted data. 


### What is human development?

Human development is the improvement of life quality in a specific country.
