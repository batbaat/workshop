# Response to Blumenstock - Don't forget about humans in data for development

### What are some of the promises and pitfalls associated with data science?

The promises that Blumenstein mention in this article are that data collected through various means, such as Facebook and international call usage, can be interpreted and used to create conclusions because of how much of a personal signature they leave behind. It can also be used to help larger groups of people as a whole, and aid with such tasks as humanitarian aid.

The downsides mentioned in this article are lack of validity, as data that proves helpful in one country may not be useful in another. Another major downside is when people realize they are being monitored, which incentivizes them to “game” the system and act in ways to benefit them, which exposes the fact of the lack of regulation. Overall, the downsides of humble data are split between the data itself and through the uncertainty and selfishness of people, such as greed and profit.
