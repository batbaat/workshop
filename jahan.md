As we continue to advance as a whole, the standards of living that we deal with also continue to advance. What many people live with in certain countries vary greatly between each other, and it is our duty to ensure that everyone in the world, regardless of country, has access to the best standards of living that can be offered to them. 

Jahan defines human development as the enlarging of people in every aspect of living.  Human development is a more holistic approach to bettering the lives of people, as it is the development of the people, by the people, for the people, with the individuals at the center of the equation. Jahan, along with the HDI, use life expectancy, income, and education in countries to measure human development. My favorite part of this podcast was where he talked about how we are too obsessed with measuring material wealth, and how that does not solely define nor lead to human development. 

In his Tedtalk, Hans Rosling discusses the two conclusions that he has created from models of development of countries. The first one that he talks about is that a strong healthcare leads to economic success. He comes up with this conclusion by basing it off of China, who previous to their booming economic success took time to improve their healthcare, and their economic growth continues to today, along with South Korea, another example he brings up. This expands off of what Jahan talked about in his podcast, as Rosling shows that rather than material wealth leading to human development, the development of people in a country leads to economic growth. Rosling also states that we should not use averages to describe development, as each country should be treated for their specific problems. An example of this is South-East Asia, as a majority of these countries are seen as third-world countries, but they all differ drastically in their make up and problems. 






## Notes

What is human development:
to enlarge people in every aspect of living

capabilities of humans must be enhanced

and the oppurtunities to use capabilities have to be improved

People have to be the center of policies of human development - people centered development

human development is the development of the people, for the people, so the benefits reach them, by the people

1.) income is a critical ingredient to increase human develo;ment
2.) hu. dev. is more holistic than others as it treats people as active agents in development
